// VERSION 1

// 1.
// Write a function that:
// - Logs to the console numbers 1 to 100.
// - However, if the number is a multiple of 3 it should log to the console "This is a multiple of 3"
// - If it's a multiple of 5 it should log "This is a multiple of 5"
// - If it's a multiple of both 3 and 5 it should log "Jackpot!"
// - Otherwise, it should just log the number
// Hint: use the modulo operator (%) to figure out if it's a multiple of 3/5. Make sure the remainder is 0, in order to pass the condition.
// Hint: the order of conditional statements is important!

// 2.
// Using JavaScript only (adding HTML to index.html is NOT allowed), write a function that:
// - Creates a button element (with text "click me!")
// - Creates an empty image element and add it to the document.
// - Inserts an image URL into the <img> tag, when the button is clicked
// - Removes the button after the click
// - Use the following image URL: https://thehub.dk/files/5ad4b4a9f9ac4aa13c3d2d58/logo_upload-6d537cf7e5de664db275b32b3c6ae12d.png

// 3.
// Write a function that:
// - Makes an API call using the Fetch API or the regular XMLHttpRequest
// - Use the following API: https://randomuser.me/api?results=3
// - Parse the response and then display the "first" and "last" names of the first three users within the DOM (inside an unordered list)
